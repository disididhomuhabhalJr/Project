    <h3>ingredients:</h3>
         <ul>
            <li>500 grams (1 lb) ground pork or beef</li>
            <li>1 medium-sized carrot, finely chopped or grated</li>
            <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon oyster sauce </li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>50 lumpia wrappers (spring roll wrappers)</li>
            <li>Cooking oil for frying</li>
         </ul>
   <h3>Instructions:</h3>
   <ol>
    <li>Prepare the Filling:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the ground pork (or beef), chopped carrots, onion, and minced garlic.</li>
            <li>Add the egg, soy sauce, oyster sauce (if using), salt, and pepper.</li>
            <li>Mix all the ingredients thoroughly until well combined. You can use your hands or a spoon to ensure the mixture is evenly seasoned.</li>
        </ul>
    <li>Wrap the Lumpia:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Separate the lumpia wrappers carefully to avoid tearing them.</li>
            <li>Place one wrapper on a clean, flat surface with one corner pointing towards you (diamond shape).</li>
            <li>Spoon about 1 to 1 Â½ tablespoons of the filling near the bottom corner of the wrapper, shaping it into a small log.</li>
            <li>Fold the bottom corner of the wrapper over the filling, then fold the sides inward.</li>
            <li>Roll the wrapper tightly towards the top corner to enclose the filling completely.</li>
            <li>Seal the edge of the wrapper with a little water or beaten egg to keep it from unwrapping during frying.</li>
            <li>Repeat the process until all the filling is used.</li>
        </ul>
    <li>Fry the Lumpia:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Heat cooking oil in a deep pan or wok over medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Once the oil is hot, carefully place the lumpia rolls into the oil, making sure not to overcrowd the pan.</li>
            <li>Fry the lumpia in batches, turning them occasionally, until they are golden brown and crispy on all sides. This usually takes about 3-5 minutes per batch.</li>
            <li>Remove the fried lumpia and drain on a paper towel-lined plate to remove excess oil.</li>
        </ul>
    <li> Serve:</li>
        <ul>
        <li>Serve the Lumpiang Shanghai hot with your choice of dipping sauce. Popular options include sweet and sour sauce, banana ketchup, or a vinegar-based dip with garlic and chili.</li>
        </ul>
   </ol>
